## Overview

This project demonstrates the conversion of voltage measurements from a temperature sensor into temperature readings using a polynomial function. What sets this project apart is that the conversion process is implemented entirely in assembly language. It showcases the power and versatility of assembly programming for low-level tasks, such as sensor data conversion.

## Features

- **Assembly Language Implementation:** The entire voltage-to-temperature conversion is carried out in assembly language, providing a deep dive into low-level programming.

- **Polynomial Regression:** The project uses a polynomial regression model to establish a mapping function for voltage-to-temperature conversion.

- **Customization:** The assembly code is well-documented, allowing you to understand and modify the polynomial function and conversion logic as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
